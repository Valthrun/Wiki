# Developing / Building the Radar
## 0. Prerequiresits
Valthrun requires the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) toolchain to be compiled.

# Starting the development environment
Note:  
This is only for the dev environment.  
The Valthrun repository does contain all release files (e.g. the server, dedicated client and the HTML files).  

In order to use the radar you have to do some steps:  
1. Start the pub / sub server:
```
cd radar\server-standalone
cargo r
```

2. Start the standalone radar client (cs2 needs to be open)
```
cd radar\client-standalone
cargo r -- -s 127.0.0.1:7228
```

3. Start the web page via webpack-dev-server
 ```
cd radar\web
$env:SERVER_URL="ws://127.0.0.1:7229/subscribe"
$env:NODE_ENV="development"
yarn start:dev
```

# Build the radar
1. Build the pub / sub server
```
cargo build --release radar-server-standalone
```
The result will be located at `target/release/radar-server-standalone.exe`

2. Build the radar client
```
cargo build --release radar-client-standalone
```
The result will be located at `target/release/radar-client-standalone.exe`

3. Build the web scripts
```ps1
  cd radar\web
  
  # Attention:
  # Set the SERVER_URL to the URL the web client should connect to.
  # You can use "ws://127.0.0.1:7229/subscribe" for a local http setup or
  # "wss://radar.valth.run/subscribe" for the official server
  $env:SERVER_URL="wss://example.com/subscribe"
  $env:NODE_ENV="development"
  
  yarn build
```
The result will be located at `dist` in `radar/web`
