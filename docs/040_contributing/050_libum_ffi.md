# Valthrun Driver Interface C API
The C API for the Valthrun Driver Interface provides a low-level, minimalistic C API for interfacing with the Valthrun Driver. All public functions are prefixed with `vtum_` to clearly separate API boundaries.

## API Structure
The API is divided into two main groups:

1. `vtum_library_*` — Library Management  
These functions manage the lifecycle and metadata of the core library.

2. `vtum_interface_*` — Driver Interface  
These functions interact with the underlying driver.

## Prebuild Libraries
Prebuilt .dll (Windows) and .so (Linux) binaries — including the corresponding header file — are available for download:  
[Download from GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Valthrun/valthrun-driver/releases/)

:::note
It is recommended to build from source to avoid version conflicts.

## Function List
<details>
```c
/**
 * Initializes the Valthrun Driver Interface C library.
 *
 * This function must be called **once** before any other functions in the library are used.
 * It sets up any required global state or resources needed by the driver interface.
 *
 * Calling any other function before `library_initialize` results in undefined behavior.
 *
 * # Safety
 * The caller must ensure that:
 * - It must be called exactly once before any other use of the library.
 * - Reinitialization or concurrent calls from multiple threads may result in race conditions
 *   or undefined behavior unless the implementation guarantees thread safety.
 */
VtumStatus vtum_library_initialize(void);

/**
 * Shutdown the Valthrun Driver Interface C library.
 * Calls to any other function are not allowed after a call to this.
 */
void vtum_library_finalize(void);

/**
 * Returns the version of the library as a null-terminated C string.
 *
 * # Safety
 * The caller must ensure that:
 * - The returned pointer must be treated as read-only.
 * - The pointer must not be deallocated or modified.
 *
 * # Returns
 * A pointer to a null-terminated C string containing the version of the library.
 */
const char *vtum_library_version(void);

/**
 * Creates a new Valthrun driver interface instance with default parameters.
 *
 * This function initializes a new `InterfaceHandle` and returns it through the provided
 * mutable reference. The resulting handle must later be destroyed using [`interface_destroy`]
 * to release associated resources.
 *
 * # Safety
 * The caller must ensure that:
 * - The caller must provide a valid, writable reference to an uninitialized `InterfaceHandle`.
 * - The memory pointed to by `result` must be valid for writing.
 *
 * # Parameters
 * - `result`: A mutable reference to an `InterfaceHandle` that will be initialized by this function.
 */
VtumStatus vtum_interface_create(InterfaceHandle **_Nonnull result);

/**
 * Destroys and frees all resources associated with an interface handle.
 *
 * This function should be called when the interface is no longer needed.
 * It releases any memory, handles, or other system resources allocated during
 * the lifetime of the interface.
 *
 * After calling this function, the pointer to the interface must not be used again.
 *
 * # Safety
 * The caller must ensure that:
 * - The caller must ensure that `interface` is a valid, non-null pointer to an `InterfaceHandle`.
 * - The handle must not be used after destruction.
 * - Double destruction or passing an invalid pointer results in undefined behavior.
 *
 * # Parameters
 * - `interface`: A pointer to a mutable `InterfaceHandle` to be destroyed.
 */
void vtum_interface_destroy(InterfaceHandle *_Nonnull interface);

/**
 * Retrieves the version information of the driver associated with the interface.
 *
 * This function fills the provided `VersionInfo` structure with version data
 * such as major, minor, and patch version numbers of the underlying driver.
 *
 * # Safety
 * The caller must ensure that:
 * - `interface` points to a valid `InterfaceHandle`.
 * - `version_info` is a valid, mutable reference to an `VersionInfo` structure.
 *
 * # Parameters
 * - `interface`: A pointer to a valid `InterfaceHandle`.
 * - `version_info`: A mutable reference to a `VersionInfo` structure that will be populated.
 */

/**
 * Returns the feature bitmask supported by the driver.
 *
 * This function returns a 64-bit bitmask indicating which optional features
 * are supported by the loaded Valthrun driver implementation.
 *
 * Each bit in the returned value represents a specific feature. You can check
 * whether a particular feature is supported using bitwise AND operations with
 * defined driver feature constants.
 *
 * # Safety
 * The caller must ensure that:
 * - `interface` must be a valid, non-null pointer to an initialized `InterfaceHandle`.
 * - `features` must be a valid mutable reference to an `DriverFeature` structure.
 *
 * # Parameters
 * - `interface`: Pointer to a valid `InterfaceHandle`.
 * - `features`: Mutable reference to an `DriverFeature` struct that will be filled
 *   with the driver's supported features.

/**
 * Reads data from the virtual memory of a target process.
 *
 * This function allows reading a block of memory from the virtual address space of a
 * specified process into a caller-provided buffer. The read operation is performed in
 * the context of the given page directory table.
 *
 * # Safety
 * This function is `unsafe` because it deals with raw pointers and cross-process memory access.
 * The caller must ensure:
 * - `interface` points to a valid `InterfaceHandle`.
 * - `directory_table_type` is a valid reference.
 * - `buffer` points to a writable memory region of at least `buffer_size` bytes.
 *
 * # Parameters
 * - `interface`: A pointer to a valid `InterfaceHandle` structure.
 * - `process_id`: The ID of the target process to read memory from.
 * - `directory_table_type`: A reference to the paging context.
 * - `address`: The virtual memory address in the target process to begin reading from.
 * - `buffer`: A pointer to the buffer that will receive the read data.
 * - `buffer_size`: The number of bytes to read.

/**
 * Writes data to the virtual memory of a target process.
 *
 * This function provides an interface for writing a buffer into the virtual address
 * space of a specified process. The memory write is performed using the paging context
 * described by the given directory table type.
 *
 * # Safety
 * The caller must ensure:
 * - `interface` points to a valid `InterfaceHandle`
 * - `directory_table_type` is a valid reference

 *
 * This function queues a metrics record identified by a type string along with
 * its associated payload. The record will be processed or submitted asynchronously
 * by the driver or associated subsystem.
 *
 * # Safety
 * The caller must ensure:
 * - `interface` must be a valid pointer to an initialized `InterfaceHandle`.
