# Install on Linux (e.g. WSL)
The PUBG Enhancer is available for Linux systems and is designed to run in a virtual machine (VM) hosted on Windows using Zenith.

:::warning
Valthrun is only supported on Windows.
Running the Enhancer on Linux is intended solely for use with Zenith in a VM!
:::

## TL;DR Installation Steps
1. Open CMD (on Windows):  
   Launch Command Prompt from the Start Menu.

2. Install WSL:  
   ```bash
   wsl --install
   ```

3. Close CMD.  

4. Download Required Binaries:  
   - [Download driver interface (Linux)](https://valth.run/portal/artifacts/driver-interface-zenith/release-linux)
   - [Download PUBG Enhancer (Linux)](https://github.com/PetrSeifert/Valthrun_PUBG/releases/latest)

5. Open WSL.  
6. Move and Rename Binaries:  
   Replace `<username>` with your actual Windows username and `[...]` with the correct version hash from the filenames.

   ```bash
   mv /mnt/c/Users/<username>/Downloads/driver_interface_zenith_[...].so libdriver.so
   mv /mnt/c/Users/<username>/Downloads/pubg_enhancer_[...].so pubg_enhancer
   ```

7. Run the Enhancer:
   ```bash
   ./pubg_enhancer
   ```

## Installation
### 1. Enable and Install WSL on Windows

1. Open Command Prompt as Administrator.
2. Run the following command to install WSL and the default Ubuntu distro:

   ```bash
   wsl --install
   ```

3. Reboot your machine if prompted.

4. Once rebooted, allow Ubuntu (or your chosen distro) to finish setting up. You will be prompted to create a **Linux username and password**â€”choose anything you like.

### 2. Download Required Enhancer Files
1. Open a browser on Windows and download the following two files:
   - **Driver Interface (Zenith)**  
     [Download driver_interface_zenith](https://valth.run/portal/artifacts/driver-interface-zenith/release-linux)
   - **PUBG Enhancer**  
     [Download pubg_enhancer](https://github.com/PetrSeifert/Valthrun_PUBG/releases/latest)

2. These will be saved in your default Windows Downloads folder, e.g.,  
   `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\Downloads\`

### 3. Move and Rename Files in WSL

1. Open WSL (Ubuntu) via the Start Menu or terminal.

2. Move and rename the downloaded files from the Windows filesystem into your Linux environment.

   Replace `<YourUsername>` with your actual Windows username, and update the filenames to match the version you downloaded (e.g., `driver_interface_zenith_ab12cd34ef.so`):

   ```bash
   mv /mnt/c/Users/<YourUsername>/Downloads/driver_interface_zenith_*.so libdriver.so
   mv /mnt/c/Users/<YourUsername>/Downloads/pubg_enhancer_*.so pubg_enhancer
   ```

   :::info
   The `/mnt/c/...` path gives WSL access to your Windows C: drive.
