# Uninstall

Uninstalling Zenith is very simple. All components of the Zenith driver exist only on the bootable USB stick created during installation. Therefore, removing Zenith only requires deleting the files from that USB stick. The easiest way to do this is to reformat the USB stick, which erases all Zenith data and restores the device for normal use as general-purpose storage.
