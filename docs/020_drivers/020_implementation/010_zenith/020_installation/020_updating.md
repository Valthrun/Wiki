# Updating

Updating Zenith is a simple and straightforward process. Since all components of the Zenith driver exist only on the created bootable USB stick, updating merely requires replacing the USB stick's contents with the new version of Zenith.  
  
## How to update
1. Download the latest Zenith Installer from the [Valthrun Portal](https://valth.run/portal/)
2. Follow the same procedure described in the [Installation Guide](../installation)
3. Once the USB stick has been updated, reboot your system to start using the new version of Zenith.

No additional configuration or manual cleanup is needed. The new version automatically replaces the old one.
