# Buying a discrete TPM
The Zenith driver is available in two configurations:
- Emulated TPM Mode – where Zenith attempts to emulate certain TPM commands.
- Hardware TPM Mode – where Zenith relies on a reset-able, modified discrete TPM chip.

The hardware-based approach offers higher consistency and security but requires a modified TPM module.

Such a TPM chip can easily be purchased through the [official Discord](../../../../general/discord) server by clicking “Order Now” in the [buy-a-tpm](https://discord.com/channels/1135362291311849693/1426277856534728864) channel under the Shop category.
Because TPM compatibility is highly dependent on your motherboard, you’ll first be asked to provide your motherboard manufacturer, product, and version. After reviewing this information, we’ll confirm compatibility and send you an order overview, remarks, and a payment link.

## Benefits of a Discrete TPM Chip

Using a modified discrete TPM chip for power-cycling means Zenith no longer needs to emulate TPM commands, avoiding potential inconsistencies caused by missing access to the TPM’s private internal keys.

With a discrete TPM, Zenith interacts with real hardware, resulting in:
- Lower detectability, since no emulation layer is involved.
- Greater stability and reliability.
- Full hardware-based attestation consistency.

A detailed technical explanation is available in [TPM Power-Cycling](../advanced-topics/tpm_power_cycle).

## How to Buy a Discrete Modified TPM Chip
You can order directly through our [Discord server](../../../../general/discord):
- Navigate to the [buy-a-tpm](https://discord.com/channels/1135362291311849693/1426277856534728864) channel under Shop.
- Click “Order Now.”
- Enter your motherboard details (manufacturer, product, version).
- Enter your shipping details.
- Wait for manual review and compatibility confirmation.
- Receive an order summary and secure payment link.

This manual review is required because each motherboard supports different TPM interfaces and pinouts.

## Terms and Conditions
- Payment is required upfront.
- If the hardware does not work, a 50 % refund will be issued as compensation.
- On delivery failure due to postal service, a 50 % refund will be issued.
- On delivery failure due to an invalid address, a 25 % refund will be issued.
- Estimated delivery time: 2–3 weeks, depending on hardware availability and shipping speed.
- Terms and conditions may change at any time without prior notice.

Please note that the above terms and conditions are for guidance only.
Final, binding terms will be provided after the manual review and compatibility confirmation of your hardware.
