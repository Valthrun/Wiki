# Custom Configuration
The Valthrun Zenith Driver comes with many customization options. The configuration file for the Zenith driver is located on the Zenith USB stick and called `zenith.toml`. Normally, this file is automatically generated by the Zenith Installer, but for troubleshooting or advanced users, you might want to adjust the configuration manually.

To create a bootable USB stick with a custom configuration, you need to use the command line interface (CLI) of the Zenith Installer. Make sure to run the CLI as an administrator.

Example workflow:
```ps1
# 1. Generate a configuration template based on your current system state
#    ATTENTION: Ensure your system is in a clean boot state before generating!
.\zenith-installer.exe internal generate-loader-config -o my-config.toml

# 2. Edit the configuration using a text editor

# 3. Validate the configuration (optional)
.\target\debug\zenith-installer.exe internal validate-loader-config .\my-config.toml

# 4. Create a bootable medium using the custom configuration
.\zenith-installer.exe create-boot-medium --config .\my-config.toml
```
