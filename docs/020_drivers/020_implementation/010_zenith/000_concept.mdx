# What is the Valthrun Zenith Driver

The Valthrun Zenith Driver is designed to read from and write to arbitrary physical or virtual memory while being completely transparent to the Windows operating system.
By using the Virtualization-Based Security (VBS) feature of Windows the Zenith migrates against typical OS-level detection mechanisms.

However, the Zenith Driver by itself is not useful; it requires an application to leverage its capabilities. 
Applications using the Zenith Driver can read and write to arbitrary Windows process and kernel memory, gaining deep insights into their state. 
This allows for deep introspection of your PC's memory without leaving any traces of such activities.

## Driver Variations
The Zenith driver is available in two configurations:
- Emulated TPM Mode – where Zenith attempts to emulate certain TPM commands.
- Hardware TPM Mode – where Zenith relies on a reset-able, modified discrete TPM chip.

The key difference between these modes lies in transparency and reliability.
The emulated mode does not require any external hardware, making it easier to set up,
but it is more likely to be flagged and therefore not recommended if full transparency is desired.

In contrast, the **hardware TPM mode provides complete transparency** and significantly improves reliability and consistency, as Zenith interacts directly with real TPM hardware.
However, it requires an externally modified TPM chip, which can be conveniently purchased through our Discord shop.

More information on how to buy a discrete modified TPM chip can be found [here](../discrete-tpm/buy).

### Warning

While the Valthrun Zenith Driver has been specifically designed to be as evasive as possible, it is important to note that no system or software can be guaranteed to remain completely undetectable in all circumstances. 
In particular, any applications —especially those running in user mode and utilizing the Valthrun Zenith Driver- could potentially be traced if specifically targeted by advanced detection techniques.

## Features

Currently, the Valthrun Zenith Driver is designed solely to read and write to arbitrary physical or virtual memory. 
It does not support functionality such as sending keyboard or mouse input. 
However, additional support for input devices, such as KMBox, may be implemented in the future.
